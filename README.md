> This repo is not updated very often, only big changes such as completely new code will be pushed weekly

## INSTALL
`pip install -r req.txt`

You must also install `ffmpeg` to actually play music, it is not a library, but an app you need to install.

For debian users: `sudo apt install ffmpeg -y`

In order to use the `;]mix` command, you must also download [this file](https://mega.nz/#!9fh1iQzC!5d9zt6yKRbAXzgyxNMmoITua09b__zlU751KKOfpRSs)
and place it in the `mix` folder [~500mb], and you must have linux because
TensorFlow won't actually install on windows from my experience

> If you have issues installing the requirements, get `pip` first.
> If you still have trouble, then idk whats happening.

## Files
> In order to ensure that this bot works properly, its best just to `git-clone` this repo.
If you don't want to, then just try downloading this repo as a zip.
If you *still* don't want to, then you have a problem.
